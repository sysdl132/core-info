Helping you make safer things \u2013 because we\u2019re all connected. Security first Security is our job from the moment you power it on. We redesigned the entire system from first boot to create the most secure embedded Linux for devices and connected things. Tamper-resistant and hardened against corruption Every aspect of the system is checked and verified. You need to know your software is pristine; not just for installation, but for the whole lifetime of the device. Immutable packages and persistent digital signatures mean Ubuntu Core can verify any software component at any time. Strict confinement everywhere One bad app shouldn\u2019t compromise the whole system You trust your developers, but anybody can make a mistake. We created a whole new armoury of Linux security capabilities to ensure all applications stay confined to their own data. 10 years security updates, by Canonical That's a decade of sleeping soundly. Ubuntu Core 18 gets 10 years of Canonical maintenance from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Your smallest devices are now as secure as your servers. No other embedded Linux comes close. Minimal core, minimal risk, minimal bugs Core is for machines, so we stripped it down to bare essentials. Fewer packages to attack, fewer bugs to fix, fewer forced changes. We reduced the OS to reduce the attack surface. That leaves more disk for your IoT applications and data. ubuntu core 18 | ========= 260MB RedHat coreos | ======================================= 807MB (all details are on https://ubuntu.com/core)","title":"Build secure IoT devices with Ubuntu Core"},{"location":"ubuntu-core-info/#build-secure-iot-devices-with-ubuntu-core","text":"Everything you love about Ubuntu, locked down for security.
